Abstract Methods :- 

		1. Abstract methods have only declaration but not implementation.
		Ex:- public abstract void sum();
		2. Abstract methods ends with semicolon not curly braces.
		3. If a class contains at least one abstract method then its compulsory to declare that   		class as abstract.
		4. Child classes are responsible for providing implementation.
	
	Vehicle:-  parent(getWheels)
		   Cycle,Car,Truck,Bus - child classes
		   Ex:- Vehcle v=new Car();
			
	WebDriver:- parent(driver.get, driver.close)
		   ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, EdgeDriver :- child classes
